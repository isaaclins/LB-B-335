# Non-Functional Requirements (FURPS)

## Functionality

1. **Local Storage Requirement**: The application must store user task data directly on the device to enable offline usage.

   - **Measurement**: All data must be persisted locally without requiring external servers or cloud services.
   - **Validation**: Verify data is saved and retrieved correctly from device storage.

2. **Offline Functionality**: The application must provide full functionality without requiring internet connectivity.
   - **Measurement**: 100% of core app features (creating, editing, completing tasks) must work without internet connection.
   - **Validation**: Testing app functionality when device is in airplane mode.

## Usability

1. **User Interface Consistency**: The application must maintain consistent design patterns across all screens.

   - **Measurement**: All UI elements must follow Flutter Material Design guidelines with consistent styling, spacing, and interaction patterns.
   - **Validation**: UI review checklist to ensure compliance with design specifications.

2. **Accessibility**: The application must be accessible to users with disabilities.
   - **Measurement**: Must achieve minimum 90% compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
   - **Validation**: Automated accessibility testing and manual verification with screen readers.

## Reliability

1. **Crash Rate**: The application must be stable with minimal crashes during normal operation.

   - **Measurement**: Crash rate must be less than 0.1% of user sessions.
   - **Validation**: Automated and manual testing across supported device configurations.

2. **Data Integrity**: The application must ensure task data is not lost or corrupted.
   - **Measurement**: Zero instances of data loss or corruption during regular use and edge cases such as low battery or interrupted operations.
   - **Validation**: Robustness testing with unexpected interruptions and app state changes.

## Performance

1. **Launch Time**: The application must start quickly to provide immediate productivity.

   - **Measurement**: Cold start time must be less than 2 seconds on reference devices (mid-range smartphones from the last 3 years).
   - **Validation**: Automated performance testing measuring app startup times.

2. **Responsiveness**: The application must respond quickly to user interactions.
   - **Measurement**: UI interactions must respond within 100ms, and all data operations must complete within 500ms.
   - **Validation**: Performance testing with timing of common interactions.

## Supportability

1. **Device Compatibility**: The application must work across a wide range of devices and OS versions.

   - **Measurement**: Must support Android 6.0 (API level 23) and above, and iOS 12 and above, covering at least 95% of active devices.
   - **Validation**: Testing on physical devices and emulators representing the supported range.

2. **Localization**: The application must support easy localization for multiple languages.
   - **Measurement**: All user-facing strings must be externalized for localization, supporting at least English, German, and Spanish initially.
   - **Validation**: Code review for proper string externalization and testing with each supported language.
